ABO Box
*******

The service name of the electronic blood certificate system is called 'ABO BOX'.  
The block wallet that stores electronic blood certificates is called a blood donation wallet.  
Allows service users (donors) to create a blood donation wallet containing the ABO Token and help keep blood donations permanently stored in the blood donation wall.  
In addition, 'ABO BOX' can be used to donate and donate electronic donations to other people's blood donation wallets.

Design Principles
=================

*  Keep blood certificate permanently
*  Disclosure of transaction details of blood certificate
*  Prevent the sale of illicit blood certificate

Roadmap
=======

Based on team and community feedback, an initial roadmap will be published for a major or minor version (ex: 2.0, 2.1).
Subminor versions will generally not have roadmaps published.

Ansible 2.1 was the first release which published this and asked for feedback in this manner.
Feedback on the roadmap and the new process is quite welcome.
The team is aiming for further transparency and better inclusion of both community desires and submissions.

These are the team's *best guess* roadmaps based on the Ansible team's experience and are also based on requests and feedback from the community.
There are things that may not make it due to time constraints, lack of community maintainers, etc.
Each roadmap is published both as an idea of what is upcoming in Ansible, and as a medium for seeking further feedback from the community.

There are multiple places for you to submit feedback:

- Add to the agenda of an IRC `Core Team Meeting <https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/master/meetings/README.md>`_ (preferred)
- Ansible's google-group: ansible-devel
- AnsibleFest conferences
- IRC Freenode channel: #ansible-devel (this one may have things lost in lots of conversation)

For additional details consult the published `Ansible Roadmap <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/roadmap/>`_.
